# Windows Mystify Screensaver in Javascript

See it in action here: http://rosenation.tv/demystify.html

This is actually my first HTML 5 web application in Javascript. It's a port of something I did in Actionscript a while back. It was super fast to port since both Javascript and Actionscript are the same language (ECMAScript) with different object models.

Originally this was a personal challenge to myself to use my I know about graphics programming to try to duplicate the Mystify Windows screensaver without looking at anything just writing it from scratch with no resources and see how fast I could do it while also being extremely efficient code wise.

The code itself (which back then was Actionscript and no HTML that you see here was required) took 15 minutes to write from top to bottom, then had some kinks as code usually does, and took another 15 minutes to debug and get into a finalized state. So total time was about 30 minutes.

Back when I learned and became an expert at Flash I formed the opinion that much of Flash was extremely buggy and unreliable and so instead of using the graphical user interface I opted more towards programming things from scratch in Actionscript, and coming from the Commodore 64 / Amiga demo scene I was always fascinated by graphics programming and exploring these things and just see what was possible.

I chose this to port to Javascript because it was the most simple one to do using the HTML 5 canvas.

HTML 5 was/is a dream for those of us who were convinced Flash was this necessary evil garbage that needed to happen to create dynamic web pages or what we now call single-page apps.

**Update:** I don't remember why I have a js file here when it obviously isn't used. I think originally I imported it into the script but I always wanted to showcase the code in my projects online so I suppose putting it in a script tag was the easiest way to pull it into the page that I found at the time.
